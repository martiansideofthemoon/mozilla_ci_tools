"""
This module contains helper methods to help schedule tasks on TaskCluster
which will use the buildbot-bridge system to trigger them on buildbot.

Instead of using LDAP credentials like for Buildapi, you need to have a set of credentials
with a couple of scopes for this purpose.

At this moment only a limited number of a Mozilla employee can create credentials for you:

* File a bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Taskcluster&component=General
* CC armenzg or adusca to vouch for you
* Ask for your client to have the same scopes as this
* https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/roles/#client-id:bbb-scheduler

After you receive your credentials you can specify your credentials with:

* export TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID=<value>
* export TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<value>

You can use the script
https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla_ci_tools/blob/master/mozci/scripts/buildbot_to_taskcluster.py
to schedule Buildbot jobs via TaskCluster.
